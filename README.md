> **"Not just a game, but a ritual for the soul."**

## ✨ The Experience: A Digital Ritual

This isn't just a list of questions. It is a **Game of Fate**. 

Unlike standard apps where you scroll endlessly, here you face a face-down spread of tarot-like cards. You must breathe, focus your intention, and let your intuition guide you to pick the card that calls to you.

### 🕯️ The Three Levels of Intimacy

The journey is divided into three distinct decks, each designed to peel back a layer of the soul:

*   **🔵 Level I: Beneath the Surface (表層之下)**
    *   *The Vibe:* Chill, playful, safe.
    *   *The Goal:* To break the ice without the cringe. Perfect for first dates or new groups.
    *   *Sample:* "If you could teleport anywhere for dinner right now, where would we go?"

*   **🌸 Level II: Into the Heart (漸入內心)**
    *   *The Vibe:* Warm, curious, revealing.
    *   *The Goal:* To understand the habits, values, and subtle emotions that make a person unique.
    *   *Sample:* "What is something you are currently trying to get better at—for yourself?"

*   **✨ Level III: The Real You (真實的你)**
    *   *The Vibe:* Vulnerable, raw, golden.
    *   *The Goal:* Deep soul connection. Only enter this level if you are ready to be truly seen.
    *   *Sample:* "What is a version of yourself you feel you are still becoming?"

## 🎨 Design & Aesthetics

We believe that deep conversations deserve a beautiful container.

*   **The Atmosphere:** A dark, mystical interface accented with gold, rose pink, and soft blue gradients.
*   **The Motion:** Realistic 3D card flips, hypnotic shuffling animations, and cinematic reveals.
*   **The Feel:** Designed specifically for **iPad Mini** and mobile devices. A "No-Scroll" interface ensures you stay focused on the person in front of you, not the technology.

## 🌏 Seamlessly Bilingual

Language should never be a barrier to connection.
*   **One Tap Toggle:** Instantly switch between **English** and **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)**.
*   **Cultural nuance:** Questions aren't just translated; they are localized to resonate with the heart in both languages.
